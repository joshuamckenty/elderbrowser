Starting from a chromium build as per
http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code
Also looked at CEF https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/,
for later research.

Using @wercker for build and deployment pipelining.
Installed https://atom.io/packages/wercker-status so I can keep an eye on it.
Then I installed the command line tools following
